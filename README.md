# Shape Stacker v4
## [MCEdit 1.0](https://github.com/Podshot/MCEdit-Unified) filter for stacking up high end Minecraft 1.8 - 1.12.2 farms

Originally I had idea for this tool to make an [enderman farm](https://youtu.be/IKguVfcysfw), so I asked [JeWe](https://github.com/JeWe37) to make it. Later we got more ideas how to enrich it, so [Robi[(https://github.com/Robitobi01) made a second version. And now I'm making third version with even more automation.
